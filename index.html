                <p>Australia is the world's sixth-largest country and the only one to govern an entire continent, known for its vast and
                diverse landscapes, including deserts, rainforests, and coastlines. It is a multicultural federation with a capital in
                Canberra, a population primarily concentrated in coastal cities, and a highly skilled workforce. The nation has a long
                history, including the continuous culture of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples for over 60,000 years, and
                was formed as a federation in 1901</p>
